For the hypothetical scenario in this exercise, I have assumed that the application worked on by a 6 people team is written in Python. Specifically, a web application built using the Django web framework.

Firstly, I will discuss tools in the Python and Django ecosystem, that can be used in implementing some of the various steps in a Continous Integrating (CI) setup. The common steps in a CI setup include:
1. Linting: application this can be achieved by using the following tools:
- [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/): A framework that manages pre-commit hooks. This framework permits you to run a list of hooks before every commit
- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): A Python code formatter that is PEP 8 compliant.
- [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/): A tool for managing import statements in Python code
- [Flake*](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/): A tool for linting Python code
- [Djlint](https://www.djlint.com/): A tool for linting Django HTML templates
2. Building: This can be done using [Buildout](http://www.buildout.org/en/latest/)
3. Testing: The Django framework uses the builtin Python [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest) library.
4. Packaging: A Django app can be packaged using [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/) to build the package and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to handle installation of the package.
5. Deploying: A Django application supports the [WSGI](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python standard for web server and application communication.

Secondly, I will discuss alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub actions for setting up CI. Some alternatives include:
1. [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/)
2. [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines)
3. [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/devops/pipelines)
4. [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci)
5. [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline)

Lastly, I will discuss the CI/CD setup environment. The decision to self-host or use a cloud-based environment depends on number of factors, like cost, technical complexity, size of the project, and the level of control required. I would assume the application built in this hypothetical scenario is a medium scale project, there cloud-based environment like GitHub actions is recommended. This solution cost less, and is less complicated to configure.
